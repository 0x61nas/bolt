### Modules 🧩

> Tauri is a backend framework that handles the integration of your Yew-based front-end with the desktop environment. It provides functionality such as networking and communication with the operating system. It packages your Yew front-end as a desktop application that can be installed and run on the user's computer.
>
> Together, the Yew and Tauri modules allow you to build a powerful, full-featured desktop application using Rust as the primary language.
* #### ***Tauri***:
    This module is responsible for implementing the business logic and functionality of bolt. It contains the core code that runs the application's features and processes user inputs.

* #### ***Yew***:
    This module is responsible for building the bolt user interface using Rust, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows you to create a responsive and dynamic front-end that can interact with the user and display information. Once the front-end is built, it is given to Tauri.
